## Cryptozombies deployed by Truffle on a private blockchain on Ganache

CryptoZombies is an interactive school that teaches you all things technical about blockchains. Throughout the learning process I wrote the contracts to make the zombies game. 

Then, I deployed it on Truffle using truffle init to create the contracts and migrations. 
Then, truffle compile will compile the contracts. A migration file was added to put the order of deployment of the contrcts.
Then, truffle migrate to migrate it to ganache and putting the truffle-config file in Ganache. 

Below are screenshots of the contracts on Ganache.
